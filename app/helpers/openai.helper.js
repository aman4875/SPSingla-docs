    NOTE:- Given the text extracted from the first page of a formal letter using Amazon Textract, transform it into a polished and professional letter format. The output should adhere to formal business communication standards, ensuring the following:
    Proper alignment: Ensure consistent margins and alignment for all elements, such as sender's and recipient's addresses, date, reference, salutation, body, and signature.

    “AFTER PROPER FORMATTING PLEASE PROCEED FURTHER”
    
    Extract and structure the following information from the given text in JSON object:
    1. Letter Number
    2. References
    3. Date
    4. Subject

    Return a JSON object with these keys:
    {
    "letter_number": "",
    "references": "",
    "date": "",
    "subject": "",
    "letter_type:"",
    }

    Rules and Clarifications :- 
    1. letter_number: Include only the first exact alphanumeric code in the specified format found in the document header and above Recipient's Address or Addressee Details. Ignore any prefixes like "Ref:" or "No:". 
    Example: SPSCPL/BSRDCL/GANGAPATH/22-23/109 , AECOM-RODIC/BSRDCL/GANGAPATH/SPSCPL/23-24/0127 , NH-12014/17/2023-RO Patna (218701)-15 etc.
    
    2. Extract only valid reference numbers found after the markers Ref:, ref:, or References: (case-insensitive). Reference numbers must not include prefixes, labels, or dates. Multiple references should be comma-separated without spaces. Exclude any prefixes or additional labels, and trim spaces within reference numbers if they exist. If no valid reference exists, return an empty string.

    Use stricter validation for extracting references. Look for valid alphanumeric patterns in the reference numbers with slashes (/), dashes (-), or numbers. Discard any generic terms or references like "EPC Contract Agreement" and other unrelated context. Make sure only valid references are included, following the specified formats.

    ### Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Valid references must align with the formatting standards demonstrated in the GOOD examples.
    2. Trim unnecessary spaces within the references (e.g., "B / W .148 / 1 / 99723 / EPC / WA" → "B/W.148/1/99723/EPC/WA").
    3. Return an empty string ("") if no valid reference numbers are found.
    4. Discard invalid examples such as generic phrases ("Your Quotation dated 15.04.2022","EPC Contract Agreement dated 26.02.2024") or improperly formatted entries.

    ### Additional Notes:
    - Extract references accurately, avoiding unrelated text or labels.
    - Always ensure the output is comma-separated and free from extra spaces.
    - Expected results should adhere to GOOD examples of formatting.

    3. date : Strictly follow 'dd/mm/yyyy' format. Convert any other date formats encountered to this standard format.

    4. If the feeded text in the "Subject" or "Sub" field contains underlined or bold text, ensure to extract that as the subject only. If no underlined or bold text is present, consider the entire text under the "Sub" field as the subject. The subject should typically include the entire section starting with "Subject:", "Sub:", or "Sub-"  Make sure to double-check everything for accuracy.

     4a: Subject to be picked up after first "- " i.e a dash and a with or without space excluding double quotes if it is there otherwise full sentence
